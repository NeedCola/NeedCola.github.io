I am graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara, in the United States, majoring in Geographic Information Science. 
Now I study in University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom as a graduate student in Applied Geographic Information System.

 In Geographic information Science, data analysis is the main method to process the geospatial information, such as changes of local land-form features, climates, populations, etc. From data wrangling and construction, we can seek more information we need in mass data, structured or unstructured.

With R project, I work on the spatial data analysis. For details please click **GIS WORK** above!
