title: "Chi Zhang's GIS Work"

Welcome! This is my personal collaboration of GIS work based on the R script.

In the **first project**, I worked with COVID-19 data in US, monitoring California's daily new cases, plotting 4 interesting states' changes of cases, and evaluating the pandemic trending on space and time. Here is the link of workflow.

# [COVID-19 Data Wrangling](https://needcola.github.io/geog-13-labs/lab-02.html)

- I was familiar with Rstudio gradually from practices, for instance, analyzing raw data with packages and plotting, combination of raw data, and extracting the variables from raw data.
- In the COVID-19 data wrangling, I started to realize the relationship among data. Data will be influenced by other variables, chronologically and spatially. 
- The structure of the code is important too. Well-structured code is easier to debug and present.

Here is my highlight in the project:

In the **project of US border**, I figured out the geographic relationship between US cities and borders of national, states, and near countries. Then I evaluated the 100-mile Border Zone described in [ACLU article](https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone).

# [Distance and Projection](https://needcola.github.io/geog-13-labs/lab-03.html)

- I learned how to build sf objects from R packages and CSVs, using computer to program the projection which studied in the Geog w12.
- In the project, I understand the calculation of distance between geographic objects, such as point, line string and area.
- And I can plot clear map with distance data by ggplot.

In the **GIS Work of Tessellations**, I started to analyze the geographic points in the polygon, with the functions defined by myself. With the raw data of dams in the United States, I tried to find the relationship between the dam distribution and geographic information. 

# [Tessellations, Point-in-Polygon](https://needcola.github.io/giswork/tessellation.html)

- **Focus**: understanding how the tessellation works. Each tessellation has its own advantages and disadvantages, and different attributes. 
- **Achievements**: 
- Analysis of the dams' data in the United States with different tessellation and identifying the difference among them, and define the numbers of dam in each tiles; 
- With the distribution of different types, demonstrating the possible reasons of the distribution
- Generation of interactive leaflet map, which shows categorical data of dams in each state within Mississippi River System.

In the **analysis of flooding**, we learned to use raster layers to analyze the continuous data, a case of flooding in Palo, Iowa. We used the raster pacakge and raster data knowledge to create flood images using multiband Landsat Imagery, thresholding and classification methods.

# [Raster and Remote Sensing](https://needcola.github.io/geog-13-labs/lab05.html)

- First time I deal with the continuous data with raster data model, and map algebra to analyze elevation, precipitation, and climate.
- In the case of Palo, I use kmean-rasters compared with Landsat band calculating the flooding cells shared by each layers. 
- And I extracted a specific location captured by the drone from layers to define its value in the raster data.

In the **GIS Work of raster analysis**, terrain analysis is managed by R coding. Mission Creek's flood event in 2017 in Santa Barbara, California has been chosen as object, estimating the number of buildings impacted. In the project, I completed the whole analysis from collecting data to the assessment of impacts.

# [Flood Risk in Mission Creek: Past, Present, Future](https://needcola.github.io/giswork/raster.html)

- **Focus**: use OSM data to collect building centroids and the stream linestring, and process spatial analysis of flooding in the study area.
- **Achievements**: 
- with the whitebox, create hillshade raster of Santa Barbara area and HAND raster for flooding cell values.
- The correcting of elevation is important in the data, which will impact the precision of analysis.
- In the final step, overlay all raster layers into one, indicating the impacted buildings when the creek flooded.
- create a gif for Mission Creek's flood inundation map library from 0 to 20 foot.
