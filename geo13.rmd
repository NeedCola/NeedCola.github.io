In the summer of 2021, I made the first project in the GIS programming class using R. I wrote some code for some awesome GIS project. Here is a collection of links!

# [Geog13_2021](https://needcola.github.io/index13.html)

- I began to be familiar with R and Rstudio: what the basic logic is, and how to use it.
- I can create a brief personal website using R and Github, that everyone visits it online easily.
- Make a good start on Geographic Information Science!

In the **lab02**, I worked with COVID-19 data in US, monitoring California's daily new cases, plotting 4 interesting states' changes of cases, and evaluating the pandemic trending on space and time. Here is the link of workflow.

# [COVID-19 Data Wrangling](https://needcola.github.io/geog-13-labs/lab-02.html)

- I was familiar with Rstudio gradually from practices, for instance, analyzing raw data with packages and plotting, combination of raw data, and extracting the variables from raw data.
- In the COVID-19 data wrangling, I started to realize the relationship among data. Data will be influenced by other variables, chronologically and spatially. 
- The structure of the code is important too. Well-structured code is easier to debug and present.

Here is my highlight in the project:
