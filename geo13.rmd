In the summer of 2021, I made the first project in the GIS programming class using R. I wrote some code for some awesome GIS project. Here is a collection of links!

# [Geog13_2021](https://needcola.github.io/index13.html)

- I began to be familiar with R and Rstudio: what the basic logic is, and how to use it.
- I can create a brief personal website using R and Github, that everyone visits it online easily.
- Make a good start on Geographic Information Science!

In the **lab02**, I worked with COVID-19 data in US, monitoring California's daily new cases, plotting 4 interesting states' changes of cases, and evaluating the pandemic trending on space and time. Here is the link of workflow.

# [COVID-19 Data Wrangling](https://needcola.github.io/geog-13-labs/lab-02.html)

- I was familiar with Rstudio gradually from practices, for instance, analyzing raw data with packages and plotting, combination of raw data, and extracting the variables from raw data.
- In the COVID-19 data wrangling, I started to realize the relationship among data. Data will be influenced by other variables, chronologically and spatially. 
- The structure of the code is important too. Well-structured code is easier to debug and present.

Here is my highlight in the project:

In the **lab03**, I figured out the geographic relationship between US cities and borders of national, states, and near countries. Then I evaluated the 100-mile Border Zone described in [ACLU article](https://www.aclu.org/other/constitution-100-mile-border-zone).

# [Distances and the Border Zone](https://needcola.github.io/geog-13-labs/lab-03.html)

- I learned how to build sf objects from R packages and CSVs, using computer to program the projection which studied in the Geog w12.
- In the project, I understand the calculation of distance between geographic objects, such as point, line string and area.
- And I can plot clear map with distance data by ggplot.

In the **lab04**, I started to analyze the geographic points in the polygon, with the functions defined by myself. With the raw data of dams in the United States, I tried to find the relationship between the dam distribution and geographic information. 

# [Tesselations, Point-in-Polygon](https://needcola.github.io/geog-13-labs/lab-04.html)

- I understand how the tessellation works. Each tessellation has its own advantages and disadvantages, and different attributes. 
- I analyze the dams data in the United States with the voronoi tessellation, defining the numbers of dam in each tiles. With the distribution of different types, I demonstrate the possible reasons of the distribution.
- And the leaflet map also be drawn, showing in largest and high_hazard dam in each state with Mississippi River System.

In the **lab05**, we learned to use raster layers to analyze the continuous data, a case of flooding in Palo, Iowa. We used the raster pacakge and raster data knowledge to create flood images using multiband Landsat Imagery, thresholding and classification methods.

# [Raster and Remote Sensing](https://needcola.github.io/geog-13-labs/lab-05.html)

- First time I deal with the continuous data with raster data model, and map algebra to analyze elevation, precipitation, and climate.
- In the case of Palo, I use kmean-rasters compared with Landsat band calculating the flooding cells shared by each layers. 
- And I extracted a specific location captured by the drone from layers to define its value in the raster data.

In the **lab06**, terrain analysis is managed by R coding. We chose Mission Creek's flood event in 2017 as object, estimating the number of buildings impacted. In the project, I completed the whole analysis from collecting data to the assessment of impacts.

# [Flood Risk in Mission Creek: Past, Present, Future](https://needcola.github.io/geog-13-labs/lab-06.html)

- I use OSM data to collect building centroids and the stream linestring. 
- with the whitebox, I create hillshade raster of Santa Barbara area and HAND raster for flooding cell values.
- The correcting of elevation is important in the data, which will impact the precision of analysis.
- In the final step, I overlay all raster layers into one, indicating the impacted buildings when the creek flooded.
- I also create a gif for Mission Creek's flood inundation map library from 0 to 20 foot.
