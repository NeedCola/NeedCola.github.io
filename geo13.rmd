title: "Chi Zhang's GIS Work"

Welcome! This is my personal collaboration of GIS work based on the R script.

In the **GIS Work of Tessellations**, I started to analyze the geographic points in the polygon, with the functions defined by myself. With the raw data of dams in the United States, I tried to find the relationship between the dam distribution and geographic information. 

# [Tessellations, Point-in-Polygon](https://needcola.github.io/giswork/tessellation.html)

- **Focus**: understanding how the tessellation works. Each tessellation has its own advantages and disadvantages, and different attributes. 
- **Achievements**: 
- Analysis of the dams' data in the United States with different tessellation and identifying the difference among them, and define the numbers of dam in each tiles; 
- With the distribution of different types, demonstrating the possible reasons of the distribution
- Generation of interactive leaflet map, which shows categorical data of dams in each state within Mississippi River System.

Here is my highlight in the project:

In the **GIS Work of raster analysis**, terrain analysis is managed by R coding. Mission Creek's flood event in 2017 in Santa Barbara, California has been chosen as object, estimating the number of buildings impacted. In the project, I completed the whole analysis from collecting data to the assessment of impacts.

# [Flood Risk in Mission Creek: Past, Present, Future](https://needcola.github.io/giswork/raster.html)

- **Focus**: use OSM data to collect building centroids and the stream linestring, and process spatial analysis of flooding in the study area.
- **Achievements**: 
- with the whitebox, create hillshade raster of Santa Barbara area and HAND raster for flooding cell values.
- The correcting of elevation is important in the data, which will impact the precision of analysis.
- In the final step, overlay all raster layers into one, indicating the impacted buildings when the creek flooded.
- create a gif for Mission Creek's flood inundation map library from 0 to 20 foot.
